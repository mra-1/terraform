splat is a expression [*] it is used in outputs that will print your 
desired output.
 resource "aws_iam_user" "lb" {
    name = "iamuser.${count.index}"
    count = 3
}

output "arns" {
    value = aws_iam_user.lb[2].arns
}

this will print out the ARN for the last user created since count works 
in a list format 0,1,2.
