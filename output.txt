outputs are a value that will print upon request they work with attributes 
attributes are defined after resource name and local name to display
the requested values. 
value = resourcename.localname.attribute - aws_eip.ip-a.public_ip =
this will print for us the public ip for local name ip-a from resource 
aws_eip after we run terraform apply

we can also use terraform output followed by output name such as 
terraform output eip or terraform output mys3bucket
